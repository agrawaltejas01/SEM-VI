Collaborative filtering is based on making predictions about a userâ€™s
preferences or tastes based on the preferences of a group of users
that are considered similar to this user.
Main challenge in this task is determining which users are similar to given one.
In order to tackle this task, there are
fundamentally 3 approaches: memory-based methods, modelbased methods and hybrid approaches

Regardless of the method used in the CF stage, the technical
objective generally pursued is to minimize the prediction errors,
by making the accuracy of the RS as high as possible.

To do this we make cluster based on importance of user x for given user y.

Importance depends on different factors such as advanced and novoice user,
teacher and student, advanced student and beginner.

To deal with this, we start from usual two-dimensional matrix of ratios R of U users for I
items and we add to it another two-dimensional matrix C for scores of U users and T level
tests or exams.

In order to evaluate the importance of knowledge of user x(Cx) for a given user y
with knowledge(Cy), we define weight relationship by
f = Cx - Cy
